# ECE-6560
Final Project for ECE 6560 at Georgia Tech


Images are a form of multimedia that conveys information using visual representations. The process of picture de-noising involves taking out the noise from images,
which is necessary to enhance their visual quality, make them more usable for analysis and interpretation, and make it possible to accurately extract information.
Several factors, including sensor noise, environmental noise, processor noise, and transmission noise, can impart noise into a picture. Image de-noising must be used to remove noise from images while maintaining the imageâ€™s key characteristics. These algorithms use a variety of approaches, including filtering, thresholding, and wavelet transforms. This activity is crucial in numerous applications, including remote sensing, computer vision, and medical imaging. In this project, we will perform image de-noising using Perona-Malik
diffusion.
